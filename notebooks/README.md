# Notebooks

This directory contains MyST Markdown computational notebooks that serve as companions to the lecture slides. Each notebook provides detailed derivations, Python implementations, and exercises.

## Contents

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| `consumption_two_period.md` | The Fisher two-period consumption problem, CRRA utility, Fisherian separation, and the labor supply puzzle |
| `olg_extra.md` | The Diamond OLG model: competitive equilibrium, social planner, Golden Rule, and dynamic efficiency |

## Libraries

The notebooks demonstrate the use of:

- **NumPy** for numerical computation
- **SciPy** for optimization (root-finding with `brentq`)
- **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **SymPy** for symbolic derivations
- **pandas** for tabular summaries

## Running the Notebooks

See the [Getting Started](../README.md#getting-started) section in the root README for initial setup.

To build the notebooks:

```bash
uv run myst build --execute
```

To run interactively in JupyterLab:

```bash
uv run jupyter lab
```

Then right-click any `.md` file and select **Open With > Notebook**.
