# Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Modeling

**Johns Hopkins University, Advanced Academic Programs**
**3.0 Credits**

## Course description

This course offers a rigorous introduction to modern macroeconomic theory, building dynamic models from first principles through the intertemporal optimization problems of households and firms. We cover the foundations of consumption theory, asset pricing, investment, and economic growth, culminating in Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) frameworks for understanding business cycles and policy effects.

The course emphasizes both analytical and computational methods, with extensive use of mathematical derivations complemented by numerical analysis using Python. Students will master core theoretical results and learn to implement solution techniques ranging from basic optimization to advanced numerical methods. We bridge theory to applications through policy analysis exercises and connections to empirical regularities.

Upon completion, students will have the analytical skills to formulate, solve, and interpret modern macroeconomic models, and the practical skills to implement these models computationally. These theoretical and quantitative skills are highly valued in academia, central banking, consulting, and finance.

### Assignment descriptions

**DataCamp assignments**
: Interactive Python exercises completed through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). These assignments reinforce programming skills and computational methods covered in class. The number of assignments will be announced during the semester.

**Weekly discussions**
: Canvas discussion prompts related to the week's topics. You must post a response to the prompt and reply to at least one colleague's post.

**Chapter assignments**
: Computational exercises completed using Python and Jupyter notebooks. These assignments reinforce the theoretical material through hands-on implementation of models and solution techniques. Collaboration with classmates is permitted, but each student must submit their own work.

**Midterm exams**
: Closed-book, in-class assessments consisting of multiple choice questions and free response problems. Questions assess both conceptual understanding and analytical problem-solving skills. Specific time limits and format details will be announced before each exam.

**Final project**
: Completed in groups of three students. The project combines computational implementation with a written report and presentation. Groups will take code and concepts learned in the course to develop a creative extension integrating DSGE with one of the other chapters (consumption, asset pricing, investment, or growth). The written component should follow academic paper conventions, including motivation, methodology, results, and interpretation. Groups will deliver a short presentation of their project on the last day of class. A detailed rubric will be provided during the semester.
