# Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Modeling

**ECON 624 | Modeling Macroeconomics (MoMa)**

*Modern macroeconomic modeling is an art. And math... and code. Lots of code.*

Course materials for ECON 624 at Johns Hopkins University.

This course offers a rigorous introduction to modern macroeconomic theory, building dynamic models from first principles through the intertemporal optimization problems of households and firms. We cover the foundations of consumption theory, asset pricing, investment, and economic growth, culminating in Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) frameworks for understanding business cycles and policy effects.

The course emphasizes both analytical and computational methods, with extensive use of mathematical derivations complemented by numerical analysis using Python.

## Topics

- Consumption theory and dynamic optimization
