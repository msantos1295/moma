## Notebooks

The following computational notebooks are companions to the reading assigned in [Lecture 03](./lecture_03.md):

- [The Envelope Condition and the Perfect Foresight CRRA Model](../notebooks/envelope_crra.md): Companion to [The Envelope Condition](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/envelope/) and [Perfect Foresight CRRA Model](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/perfforesightcrra/)
- [The Consumption Random Walk and the Permanent Income Hypothesis](../notebooks/random_walk_cons_fn.md): Companion to [Consumption Random Walk](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/randomwalk/) and [The Consumption Function](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/consumptionfunction/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

1. Apply the envelope theorem to derive the Euler equation for multiperiod problems
2. Solve the infinite-horizon perfect foresight CRRA consumption problem and identify the patience conditions (AIC, FHWC, RIC, GIC) required for a well-defined solution
3. Derive Hall's random walk result from quadratic utility and explain its testable implications
4. Compute the marginal propensity to consume out of transitory versus permanent income shocks
5. Explain why the Keynesian consumption function is incomplete without specifying the income process

## Key Concepts

- **Envelope condition**: The marginal value of resources equals the marginal utility of consumption, extending the Euler equation beyond two periods
- **Patience factor**: The growth rate of consumption under CRRA utility, determined by the interest rate, discount factor, and risk aversion
- **Impatience conditions**: Restrictions on parameters that ensure human wealth, the PDV of consumption, and the wealth-to-income ratio are all finite
- **Consumption random walk**: Hall's result that no lagged information predicts consumption changes, providing a model-free test of the Euler equation
- **Muth's decomposition**: The marginal propensity to consume depends on whether an income shock is transitory or permanent, not on its size

## Reading Assignment

:::{attention} Required Reading
Before Lecture 05, read the following chapters from [A Gentle Introduction to Intertemporal Choice](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/):

1. [Habits](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/habits/)
2. [Durables](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/durables/)
3. [Laibson](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/laibson/)

These readings extend the baseline consumption framework: habit formation introduces path dependence in utility, durable goods require distinguishing between the stock of durables and the flow of services they provide, and Laibson's quasi-hyperbolic discounting captures time-inconsistent preferences.
