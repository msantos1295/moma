## Materials

- [Slides: Intertemporal Choice](/slides/m03/intertemporal-choice-slides.html)

## Notebooks

The following computational notebooks are companions to the reading assigned in [Lecture 02](./lecture_02.md):

- [Two-Period Consumption and Labor Supply](../notebooks/consumption_two_period.md): Companion to [The Period Life Cycle Model](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/periodlcmodel/) and [Consumption and Labor Supply](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/consandlaborsupply/)
- [The Diamond OLG Model](../notebooks/olg_extra.md): Companion to [The Overlapping Generations Model](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/olgmodel/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

1. Set up and solve the two-period consumption problem
2. Derive and interpret the Euler equation
3. Explain Fisherian separation and its implications
4. Describe the Diamond OLG model with population growth
5. Distinguish between competitive equilibrium, social optimum, and Golden Rule steady states
6. Define dynamic efficiency and explain why the first welfare theorem can fail in OLG economies

## Key Concepts

- **Intertemporal budget constraint**: The present value of lifetime consumption equals total wealth
- **Euler equation**: The optimality condition equating marginal utility costs and benefits of saving
- **Intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES)**: How consumption growth responds to interest rate changes
- **Fisherian separation**: Consumption depends on total wealth, not on the timing of income
- **Dynamic efficiency**: Whether reducing capital can raise consumption for all generations

## Reading Assignment

:::{attention} Required Reading
Before Lecture 04, read the following chapters from [A Gentle Introduction to Intertemporal Choice](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/):

1. [The Envelope Condition](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/envelope/)
2. [Perfect Foresight CRRA Model](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/perfforesightcrra/)
3. [Consumption Random Walk](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/randomwalk/)
4. [The Consumption Function](https://jhu-econ.github.io/intertemporal-choice/content/consumption/consumptionfunction/)

These readings extend the two-period framework to infinite horizons, introduce the Bellman equation, and develop the consumption function under uncertainty.
