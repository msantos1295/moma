# QuantEcon

This directory contains MyST Markdown source files from the [QuantEcon Python Programming](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/) lecture series.

## Why Local Copies?

We store these lectures locally to:

- **Ensure reproducibility** — Upstream changes won't affect student work mid-semester
- **Maintain consistency** — All students work with the same version
- **Enable offline access** — No dependency on external servers during class

## Attribution

These lectures are developed by and belong to [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/). All credit goes to the QuantEcon team and contributors.
