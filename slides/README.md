## Building Slides Locally

Slides are built with [Quarto](https://quarto.dev/). To build or preview slides on your own computer:

### 1. Install Quarto

Download and install Quarto from [quarto.dev/docs/get-started](https://quarto.dev/docs/get-started/).

Alternatively, use a package manager:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install quarto

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install quarto

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) - download .deb from quarto.dev
sudo dpkg -i quarto-*.deb
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
quarto --version
```

### 2. Preview Slides

From the project root directory:

```bash
uv run quarto preview slides/m03/intertemporal-choice-slides.qmd
```

This opens a live preview in your browser that updates as you edit.

### 3. Build All Slides

To build all slides to HTML:

```bash
uv run quarto render slides/
```

The output files are placed alongside the source `.qmd` files.
